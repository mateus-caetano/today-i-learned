# JSON-SERVER
> A full fake REST API

#### **DESCRIPTION**
This is a full fake REST API. With it, you can test your front-end aplication without necessity to develop a backend before.

#### **HOW TO USE**
To use, it is very simple. Just creat a JSON file and, in terminal, run:
> `json-server file_name.json`

In this example I used a JS file to create automatically 100 users. For this, I export by default an arrow function that instantiates and fills a data object.
